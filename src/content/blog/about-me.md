### Let me introduce myself

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm Praanesh Balakrishnan Nair, a tech-savvy person also having a strong passion for automobiles.  


### How it all started for me 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been spending a lot of time tinkering with my laptop, ever since I first got my hands on one. Over the course of time, I've learnt a lot in various domains almost completely by accident. This "accidental learning" was the thing that made tech as a whole so fun for me. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While more details on this is definitely a tale for another day, everything unfolded because I was fully committed to fixing an old HP Envy m4 (2012). However, none of the solutions I proposed were even close to fixing anything of the laptop. To be fair, I never really did my homework before trying anything. I just jumped right into it. For instance, I went straight to changing the OS instead of looking at network drivers to fix connectivity issues ðŸ˜†.  

### What's with the website

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my website, form doesn't really follow function. All I wanted was a unique website to call mine, and I have it now ðŸ™‚.
