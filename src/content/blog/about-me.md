### Let me introduce myself

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm Praanesh Balakrishnan Nair, a tech-savvy person also having
a strong passion for automobiles. I go by the persona of "CompileArtisan", a random name I chose for 
myself. 


### How it all started for me 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been spending a lot of time tinkering with my laptop, ever since I first got my hands on one. Over the course of time, I've learnt a lot in various domains almost completely by accident. This "accidental learning" was the thing that made tech as a whole so fun for me. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While more details on this is definitely a tale for another day, everything unfolded because I was fully committed to fixing an old HP Envy m4 (2012). However, none of the solutions I proposed were even close to fixing anything of the laptop. To be fair, I never really did my homework before trying anything. I just jumped right into it. For instance, I went straight to changing the OS instead of looking at network drivers to fix connectivity issues XD.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I've tried many different operating systems on my trusted 
steed (what I call my laptop) and I think now you see why my website is themed like a BIOS.

### What's with the website

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my website, form doesn't really follow function. All I wanted was
a unique website to call mine, and I have it now :) . Moreover, I was quite inspired by 
[Adithya's](https://adithyanair.com/) and [Nikhil's](https://heftymouse.me/) work, and their initiative of
[amrita.town](https://amrita.town/).
