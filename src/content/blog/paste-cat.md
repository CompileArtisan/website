description: "How uniqueness and inspiration met in my workflow"
---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Praanesh of 2024 was a person with a stable
workflow on Windows. I've tried many operating systems and I've found myself
very comfortable with Windows 11 over the past 3 years. Enter the year 2025, and
the way I use a laptop is not what it once was.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My pursuit of finding the best operating
system started off with trying ChromeOS. It was 2019 and I was running Windows
10 on my HP Envy m4. It was around that time when I discovered what Chromebooks
were. I was really intrigued by the fact that progressive web apps can almost
replace any native app I would ever use (as a kid of 9th grade of course).
Chromebooks are models certified by Google to ship with ChromeOS. So if your
laptop didn't ship with ChromeOS, you can't install ChromeOS. As simple as that.
I tried a bunch of different ChromeOS distributions, none of which were from
Google (obviously). Now I found it hard to work with Microsoft Office, and I
wanted to go back to Windows. This was a little bit of an issue, because I
didn't have a plan B (read: no Windows-bootable device as backup). This kept getting worse
and worse. Making a Windows-bootable device in ChromeOS is utter nonsense (it's
a browser guys), and this was the only computer I had at home. I almost had to
settle for ChromeOS forever. _Almost_, because life had something else in stock
for me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem was simple: I couldn't go from
ChromeOS to Windows. Later on, I found out that I was right about going from
ChromeOS to Windows _directly_. But that doesn't mean you can't go to Windows at
all. You can go to a Linux distro, and then from there you can make a
Windows-bootable device. I've used my dad's laptop from 2003 (in 2010) which had
Linux Mint, so this definitely wasn't my first encounter with linux. Now that I
have linux, I realized that unleashed a whole new breed of freedom.
