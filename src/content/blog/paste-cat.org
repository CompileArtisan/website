* Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Praanesh of 2024 was a person with a stable
workflow on Windows. I've tried many operating systems and I've found myself
very comfortable with Windows 11 over the past 3 years. Enter the year 2025, and
the way I use a laptop is not what it once was.

* The hunt for the right setup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you've read my [[https://compileartisan.pages.dev/blogs/about-me]["about-me" blog]], you'd
have found my trusted steed, not-so-trusted because of how I had to "fix" it.
My pursuit of finding the best operating system started off with trying
ChromeOS. It was 2019 and I was running Windows 10 on my HP Envy m4. It was
around that time when I discovered what Chromebooks were. I was really intrigued
by the fact that progressive web apps can almost replace any native app I would
ever use (as a kid of 9th grade of course). Chromebooks are models certified by
Google to ship with ChromeOS. So if your laptop didn't ship with ChromeOS, you
can't install ChromeOS. As simple as that. I tried a bunch of different ChromeOS
distributions, none of which were from Google (obviously). Now I found it hard
to work with Microsoft Office, and I wanted to go back to Windows. This was a
little bit of an issue, because I didn't have a plan B (read: no
Windows-bootable device as backup). This kept getting worse and worse. Making a
Windows-bootable device in ChromeOS is utter nonsense (it's a browser guys), and
this was the only computer I had at home. I almost had to settle for ChromeOS
forever. /Almost/, because life had something else in stock for me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem was simple: I couldn't go from
ChromeOS to Windows 10. Later on, I found out that I was right about going from
ChromeOS to Windows /directly/. But that doesn't mean you can't go to Windows at
all. You can go to a Linux distro, and then from there you can make a
Windows-bootable device. I've used my dad's laptop from 2003 (in 2010) which had
Linux Mint, so this definitely wasn't my first encounter with linux. I got
Ubuntu on my trusted steed and Now that I have linux, I realized that unleashed
a whole new breed of freedom. I went on to make my Gnome desktop, a macOS
Catalina clone :-P. What was supposed to be my intermediate OS, now became my
primary setup. Application support was way better than ChromeOS. What was
supposed to be my intermediate OS, now became my primary setup. Application
support was way better than ChromeOS, so it was definitely an upgrade. The
LibreOffice suite did have a lot to offer, and could easily replace Microsoft
Office in my life.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't quite remember why, but I really
wanted to go back to Windows. This intermediate OS was fun, but I thought it was
finally time to press onward with installing Windows 10. I thought I'll try dual
booting, since I did look back and simply appreciate my Catalina-flavoured
Gnome. I buckled up and set out by downloading the ISO, creating the bootable
media, and shrinking the volume â€” just the usual routine. It was all sunshine
and rainbows until I accidentally deleted the partition which had Linux on it ðŸ’€.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to wait for *months* before I could
get hold of another laptop, to make myself a bootable USB drive. In the
waiting-period I started revisiting Windows 8.1, and all the keynotes about it.
I really did fall for its charm ([[https://compileartisan.pages.dev/charm-bar.jpg][pun intended :)]]). So I threw in Windows 8.1 on
my trusted steed, and I experienced speeds I never witnessed before. I wondered
if I was too young to truly appreciate this back in 2012. The Metro interface
was incredibly fluid and the boot-up time was no longer than 10 seconds! This
was when I actually became a good Windows user, learning all the shortcuts and
working my own ways around the OS. What also helped me fly around was my new
profound love for touch-typing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here comes a chunk of time missing from my
memory.
