I'm a tech-savvy person with a strong passion for automobiles. I go by the
persona of "CompileArtisan", a random name I chose for myself.

I've been spending a lot of time tinkering with my laptop, ever since I first
got my hands on one. Over the course of time, I've learned a lot in various
domains almost completely by accident. This "accidental learning" was the thing
that made tech as a whole so fun for me.
